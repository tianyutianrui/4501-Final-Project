This project was designed to study the performance of Taxi and Uber under the influence of time, location, and weather. We download data from official websites and conducted data cleaning and filtering. Then we stored the cleaned data in the SQLite database, generating four tables for Taxi trips, Uber trips, daily weather, and hourly weather information. Next, to check the correctness of data we processed and to better understand our datasets, we defined queries for six statistical questions and find answers. Finally, we created visualizations, including histograms, line chart, scatter plots, and, heat map to better interpret and recognize the performance of Taxi and Uber trips, and their relationship with weather, location, and time.
