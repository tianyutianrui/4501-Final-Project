This project is designed to study the performance of Taxi and Uber rides from Jan 2009 to June 2015 regarding to specific time, location, and weather. We downloaded data from official websites and conducted data cleaning and filtering. Then we stored the cleaned data in the SQLite database, generating four tables for Taxi trips, Uber trips, daily weather, and hourly weather data. Next, to check the correctness of data we processed, and to better understand our datasets, we defined 6 queries to answer 6 different statistical questions. Finally, we created visualizations such as histogram, line chart, scatter plot, and heatmap to better interpret and recognize the performance of Taxi and Uber trips in each circumstance.
